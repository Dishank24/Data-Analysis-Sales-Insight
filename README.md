# Data-Analysis-Sales-Insight
This is a complete real-world Data Analysis Project. 

MySQL was used to collect the data and perform some initial analysis. Then linked this MySQL Database to PowerBi and performed ETL using PowerBi's Power Query feature. After ETL, I made some custom formulaes that I used in my report. Finally, I built the Dashboard/Report using different charts, cards and slicers. 

Tasks performed-
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Wrangling
4. Data Visualization.
